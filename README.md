# Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Selection for E-Scooter Rental



## About The Project

The given E-Scooter rental data is prepared for exploration by checking for missing data and performing basic data cleaning. Feature engineering was performed by extracting year, month, day of week and total users from existing features. The skewed target values was transformed to be closer to normal distribution to improve the performance of the machine learning models. Unnecessary features were removed from the dataset and the data was split into training and validation sets. Machine learning algorithms were applied to the data and the model with the best accuracy was selected. Further optimisation of the hyperparameters for the selected model was performed to facilitate predicting the total number of active users in order to help in demand forecasting.
